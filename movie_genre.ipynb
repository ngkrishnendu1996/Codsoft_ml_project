In most of the bigger airports in Europe nowadays there exist so called zone d'atont\\u00e9s, spaces in which sans papiers, refugees, are kept, not knowing how long this condition will last. In most of the cases the journey back is inevitable. Such a room is the starting point of the story. In this context two men of African descent are prisoners as well as guards patrolling through the airport. The guards change the rules and present themselves now as those who rule over the territory of the airport. The protagonists are not representing a militaristic - police power, on the contrary, their determination is the consequence of loss of control. The Asian passenger, accidentally at the scene of action, in place of the viewer, gets in between the front lines.\\n9643 ::: Port Authority-Sealed Containers: Long Beach (2018) ::: crime ::: Returning Long Beach wounded Marine LILLY MENENDEZ returns to her dysfunctional family and is forced by economic circumstances to immediately take a position at the LAPD Long Beach Port Authority.

BattleGround is an irreverent journey that will challenge the orthodoxies of Left and Right, and highlight the humanity of all sides of the conflict. BattleGround will be a critical film for anyone who wants to understand the powerful forces that are sucking America deeper and deeper into a Middle Eastern quagmire. Is Iraq our generation's Bright Shining Lie, or is it the frontline in a global battle for national survival?

The journey (450 miles, as a crow flies) across unmapped territory took seven months; three Muyu porters died. Near both coasts, the expedition met villagers who invited them to observe rituals and live with them. In the interior, all villagers kept them at bay, and they depended on air lifts from Hollandia for food and supplies. They climbed above 10,000 feet, built 14 bridges, and fought leeches and malaria. The narrator focuses on describing Stone Age savages, headhunters, and cannibals.\\n9648 ::: Shado'man (2013) ::: documentary ::: Shado'man is a cinematic journey undertaken by the filmmaker together with the street boys.

Violence was endemic to the process, for how else could the Africans already living there be persuaded to cede their land, labor, property and freedom to foreigners? Colonialism's brutal dialectic of repression and resistance was set in motion, as Africans fought to defend their lives and, eventually, organized national political movements and underground military ones to win their rights and freedom. White Man's Country combines period photographs and contemporary location footage with the testimony of African and European witnesses, to examine both sides of Europe's civilizing mission in Africa.\\n9650 ::: Sugar Dome (2012) ::: reality-tv ::: Remarkable artists of all types team up for a one-of-a-kind competition to create the most jaw-dropping displays on earth in the new series Sugar Dome.

Their Irish immigrant parents knew each other in the old country - and Carl's parents want better for their son than Annie, who was raised in the slums. When Annie runs away to marry Carl while he's at college, they have many difficulties, including a college Dean that frowns upon married couples, Carl's angry parents, Carl's jealousy, and Annie's own problems with her sexuality. In 1927, young second generation Irish-American couple Carl Brown and Annie McGairy decide to get married despite things working against them. Those issues are many. Annie comes from a poor, uneducated and broken family, where her stepfather abuses her and is jealous of Carl, which in turn makes her mother throw her out. That abuse coupled with her otherwise sexual inexperience taints the way she views human interaction. His parents, who come from a working class background themselves, wanted Carl to marry into a respectable family. Because of Carl's promising future, they view Annie purely as a gold digger. Neither Carl or Annie have any money since Carl spends whatever he has on his law schooling, which still is paid for primarily by his parents and school loans. That schooling, and the job he gets as college grounds caretaker which comes with a small cottage for them to live in on campus, preoccupies his time. As their marriage progresses, there are further pressures. She becomes jealous of his past relationship with a co-ed, and with his college life in general which is foreign to her. Her association and friendship with Anthony Byrd, a homosexual florist, and with Bev Karter, a single mother who is in an extramarital relationship with Stan Pulaski, an older, married and generous man, fuels gossip which negatively affects Carl's view of her on-campus life. The one bright spot seems to be Annie unofficially and clandestinely auditing an English class, which feeds her thirst for knowledge. The question becomes if their marriage can withstand these and other pressures that come with marriage.\\n9654 ::: Scale (????) ::: comedy ::: Some things in life are bad, They can really make you mad.
